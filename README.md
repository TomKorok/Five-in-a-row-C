# Project Name
Five-in-a-row-C

## Description
A five in a row game in C.
The project was my first-semester bachelor's university project, and I scored the highest grade :)
The game contains a bot with a very basic strategy and is displayed on the console. The project was created as part of a Hungarian course hence all the names are Hungarian.
